The second file seems to be empty, so we'll focus on the contents of the first file. Here's a brief breakdown of the work instructions provided for reviewing AI responses:

1. **Filtering Complaints:**
   - Identify and separate complaints from users regarding the AI responses. This can help in addressing specific issues that users are facing.

2. **Identifying Response Trends:**
   - Analyze the responses to find common trends or patterns. This information can be used to generate feedback that assists content creators in refining their work.

3. **Managing Prompt Responses:**
   - Effectively organize and manage the responses to prompts, possibly by categorizing or tagging them for easier review.

4. **Separating Feedback:**
   - Distinguish between positive and negative feedback on AI responses. This helps in evaluating overall user satisfaction and areas needing improvement.

5. **Formatting Reviews:**
   - Structure the reviews of prompt responses in a clear and easily digestible format. This can involve creating summaries, charts, or bullet points.

6. **Providing Improvement Suggestions:**
   - Offer constructive suggestions for negative feedback on how work instructions could be improved to elicit better AI responses. This involves understanding the root cause of dissatisfaction and proposing actionable changes.

These steps are aimed at ensuring that the AI responses are continually improving and are better aligned with user expectations. Would you like to dive deeper into any specific point?
