It seems you provided part of a document related to work instructions for reviewing AI-generated messages, specifically focusing on filtering and analyzing user feedback. However, the second file (`/home/debian/.config/aichat/messages.md`) does not contain any content. 

Based on the content from the first file, here's a brief overview of how you might proceed with message review:

1. **Filtering Complaints**:
   - Identify user complaints or dissatisfaction within the messages. This could be explicit (e.g., "I am not satisfied with...") or implicit (e.g., negative language or tone).

2. **Identifying Response Trends**:
   - Look for recurring themes or issues in user feedback. Are there particular prompts or responses that repeatedly generate similar user reactions?

3. **Managing Prompt Responses**:
   - Ensure each prompt response is appropriate and provides value to the user. Assess if responses align with user expectations and the intended purpose of the prompt.

4. **Separating Feedback**:
   - Categorize feedback into positive and negative sections. This segmentation helps in focused analysis and improvement planning.

5. **Formatting Reviews**:
   - Present feedback in a structured format that's easy to analyze. This might include bullet points, tables, or categorized lists to enhance readability.

6. **Suggestions for Improvement**:
   - When handling negative feedback, suggest actionable improvements to content creators. This might involve rephrasing prompts, adjusting tone, or providing additional context to better address user queries.

If you intended to add more content or have specific parts of a document to review, feel free to provide additional context or details!
