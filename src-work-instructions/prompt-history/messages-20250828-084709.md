Based on the content from `/opt/work-instruction/ehmanas/ai-llm-operations-wi-chat/src-work-instructions/airole-message-review.md`, here is a structured approach for managing and reviewing prompts and AI responses:

1. **Filtering Complaints**:
   - Identify and extract any complaints from users regarding the AI's responses or behavior.
   - Categorize complaints to understand common issues or areas needing improvement.

2. **Identifying Response Trends**:
   - Analyze responses to detect patterns or trends over time.
   - Highlight common positive feedback trends that indicate successful areas.
   - Note frequent negative feedback to address and improve.

3. **Managing Prompt Responses**:
   - Organize and categorize prompt responses for easier access and review.
   - Ensure consistency and comprehensibility in response data presentation.

4. **Feedback Separation**:
   - Differentiate between positive and negative feedback.
   - Present feedback in a clear and segregated manner, aiding quicker assessment.

5. **Formatting Reviews**:
   - Create an easy-to-read format for prompt reviews, possibly using tables or bullet points for clarity.
   - Ensure clarity in presenting both positive and negative aspects in reviews.

6. **Suggestions for Improvement**:
   - Analyze negative feedback and provide actionable suggestions for enhancement.
   - Offer specific improvements to work instructions to address shortcomings and better fulfill prompt requirements.

By applying this structured process, content creators can more effectively utilize user feedback to enhance and refine their work instructions, ultimately improving the quality and relevance of AI responses.
