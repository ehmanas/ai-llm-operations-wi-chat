It looks like you have content related to handling and reviewing AI-generated prompts and responses from users. Here's a brief overview of how to approach the tasks mentioned:

1. **Filter Complaints**: Look for direct expressions of dissatisfaction or issues raised by users in their feedback or prompt responses. These could be explicit complaints or inferred through negative sentiment.

2. **Identify Response Trends**: Analyze a set of responses to identify patterns or recurrent themes. This can include common requests for improvements or recurring issues experienced by multiple users.

3. **Manage Prompt Responses**: Organize the responses in a systematic way, perhaps categorizing them by type, sentiment, or topic. This helps in better understanding and addressing the feedback.

4. **Separate Positive and Negative Feedback**: Use sentiment analysis techniques to classify feedback into positive and negative categories. Positive feedback often includes praise or satisfaction, while negative feedback highlights issues or disappointments.

5. **Format Prompt Reviews**: Ensure the feedback is presented in a clear and structured format. This could involve summarizing the points, categorizing them, and making them easily digestible for content creators.

6. **Suggestions on Negative Feedback**: Provide actionable recommendations on how to tweak or enhance the work instructions to mitigate negative feedback. This could involve clarifying instructions, adding detailed examples, or adjusting the AI's behavior to better align with user expectations.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively assist work instruction content creators in refining their content and improving user satisfaction.
